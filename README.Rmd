This package contains datasets used in:

> Binford, Lewis R. 2001. _Constructing Frames of Reference: An Analytical Method for Archaeological Theory Building Using Ethnographic and Environmental Data Sets_ University of California Press, Berkeley.

This package contains three datasets:

-   `LRB`: environmental and hunter-gatherer data used in Binford's book
-   `LRBfact`: equal to LRB except code values are represented by their label, rather than the code
-   `LRBkey`: key to the LRB data frame   

The data were obtained from Amber Johnson's website on 31 Jul 2016: http://ajohnson.sites.truman.edu/data-and-program/

This package and the datasets have also been archived on Zenodo:
